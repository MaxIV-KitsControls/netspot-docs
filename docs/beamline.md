# Beamline Support

## Beamline support

Users that login for the first time only get access to the "Beamline Support" version of NetSPOT.

In this mode only a subset of the functionallity is available. No changes are allowd.

### Allow access to network ports for a specific beamline

In order for a user to gain access to ports on a beamline the user needs to be member of that specific group.

Go to netspot/docs/index.htm and login.

Find the user and add him to the beamline group. The user should now be able to troubleshoot and deploy ports for this beamline.

### Granting access to all ports

Some users might have to have access to all ports on the network but not access to the full NetSPOT interface.

To do this, add this user to the "ALL" group in netspot/docs/index.htm

### Full NetSPOT interface

For a user to gain full access the user needs to be marked as "Staff" in netspot/admin.
